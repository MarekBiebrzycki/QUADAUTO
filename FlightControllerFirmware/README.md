<h1>Quad Automotive Group Flight Controller Firmware</h1>
This is not a Arduino project. The Code is for a board know as the FlyMaple. While we had developed our own version of the FlyMaple before we had know that the FlyMaple existed one day while browing for parts we discovered the FlyMaple. The Flymaple was almost an exact duplicate of what we were developing so for our Phase one work to save both time and fincial resources we changed up our plans and decided to switch to the FlyMaple before sending our boards off to Production. Use of this code requires a FlyMaple Board as well as The MapleIDE which is almost exactly the same as the Arduino IDE with some minor modifications and a change out of the compiler tools to the GCC ARM compiler instead of the AVR compiler. More information will be updated soon providing links to all of the Libaries we use.
